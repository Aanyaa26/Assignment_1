This project is a backend API built using FastAPI that accepts structured JSON payloads, performs data validation and quality checks using Pydantic, and stores the validated data in a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM.
The entire application is containerized using Docker and managed with Docker Compose to ensure consistent and reproducible environments.
